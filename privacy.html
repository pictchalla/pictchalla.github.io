We may, but have no obligation to, monitor and review new accounts before you may sign in and use our Services. Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the termination of your account.

We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill.

It is your sole responsibility to maintain appropriate backup of your Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on some occasions and in certain circumstances, with absolutely no obligation, we may be able to restore some or all of your data that has been deleted as of a certain date and time when we may have backed up data for our own purposes. We make no guarantee that the data you need will be available.</span></p>

We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the content of their mobile applications. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, products, services, and content of any other third-parties. You should carefully review the legal statements and other conditions of use of any mobile application which you access through a link from Pictchalla. Your linking to any other off-site mobile applications is at your own risk.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Prohibited uses</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In addition to other terms as set forth in the Agreement, you are prohibited from using Pictchalla or its Content: (a) for any unlawful purpose; (b) to solicit others to perform or participate in any unlawful acts; (c) to violate any international, federal, provincial or state regulations, rules, laws, or local ordinances; (d) to infringe upon or violate our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others; (e) to harass, abuse, insult, harm, defame, slander, disparage, intimidate, or discriminate based on gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, race, age, national origin, or disability; (f) to submit false or misleading information; (g) to upload or transmit viruses or any other type of malicious code that will or may be used in any way that will affect the functionality or operation of the Service or of any related mobile application, other mobile applications, or the Internet; (h) to collect or track the personal information of others; (i) to spam, phish, pharm, pretext, spider, crawl, or scrape; (j) for any obscene or immoral purpose; or (k) to interfere with or circumvent the security features of the Service or any related mobile application, other mobile applications, or the Internet. We reserve the right to terminate your use of the Service or any related mobile application for violating any of the prohibited uses.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Intellectual property rights</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This Agreement does not transfer to you any intellectual property owned by Pictchalla or third-parties, and all rights, titles, and interests in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with Pictchalla. All trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with Pictchalla, are trademarks or registered trademarks of Pictchalla or MPictchalla licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with Pictchalla may be the trademarks of other third-parties.

The limitations and exclusions also apply if this remedy does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential purpose.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Severability</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be exercised and shall be applicable and binding only to the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited to the extent necessary so that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the remaining provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining provisions or portions thereof shall remain in full force and effect.</span></p>
